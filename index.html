        <h1>Recomputing</h1>
        <p>
            Hi. Recomputing is a new project focused on making data and content
            more accessible and explorable. It aims to empower small-scale API and 
            content providers, and enable non-centralized ways for users to explore that 
            data and content.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core Recomputing project is Topiary – an open source data aggregation 
            engine, as well as multiple front-ends to it. The initial implementation is 
            being made with Typescript, designed as a browser extension with an HTML 
            front-end. (This version is currently in beta, and is nearing a public
            release.) A second version of the engine is planned, to be written in Julia,
            with various platform-specific front-ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, two services built on top of Topiary are planned – one 
            enterprise-focused and the other consumer-focused.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recomputing is based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota.
